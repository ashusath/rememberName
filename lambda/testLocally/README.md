# Test Lamda function Locally
While building Alexa Skills, one of my major issues was testing the Lamda function I had written locally. I bumped into [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2s2o5vM1Z4) tutorial by Steve from [Dabble Lab](http://dabblelab.com/).
Credits and a shoutout to him for helping the universe with this.

You should also probably subscribe to their channel and give a thumbs up.

Just copy paste the request from yout testing console in the Alexa Skills testing area and you are good to go.
